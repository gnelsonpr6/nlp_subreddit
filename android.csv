95,Android,"My OnePlus 6T died after an unfortunate drop into concrete. I was expecting a call that day, so I went to a local store and bought a Moto G Fast thinking I'd use it temporarily before getting a ""real phone"" and I'd keep the Moto G as a backup.

You know what though? I'm keeping it as my daily driver. It's actually *shockingly* good. The battery lasts longer than my old phone. It's got a headphone jack! What $1000 phone has one if those these days? It's not filled with bloatware, and it does the basics all pretty well. Calls sound no different. The speaker is good enough. The vibration motor is significantly better than my previous phone. 

I thought I'd mind a 720p display, but honestly I've stopped noticing. Who needs 90hz 1440p displays anyway? It just seems like overkill to me now.

Sure, it's not always the snappiest device in the world and isn't made of super premium materials. It's got bigger bezels than a higher tier phone would have. But who cares? Honestly the only thing that bothers me really is Motorola's update policy. But I've used plenty of other much more expensive phones with pretty shit update policies too.",Kind of shocked by how good my $150 phone is.

69,Android,"Greetings Mobile Accomplishers:

I'm Dieter, one of the founding editors at The Verge and currently our Executive Editor. I also tweet puns sometimes and typos always over at [@backlon](https://twitter.com/backlon).

I've been reviewing Android and Android phones since the very beginning, with [Android on the G1 over at Android Central](https://www.androidcentral.com/review-android-t-mobile-g1). Whenever I get called an Apple shill I remind people I founded Android Central. Whenever I get called an Android shill I remind people I founded iMore. I'm obsessed with RCS for some reason? Also the web. Also, yes, webOS.

I used a Galaxy S20 for most of the year, but recently switched over to a Pixel 5 (There was some OnePlus and Galaxy Z Flip in there for awhile too). I of course also use iPhones -- usually I have two phones on me.

Anyway I'm fascinated by consumer tech and think that it deserves genuine attention as a category of products that takes part in creating our culture. I also believe that most people are smarter than they're given credit for and shouldn't be talked down to when it comes to tech. When I have the time I [make videos in that vein](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL39u5ZEfYDEOI-EYh3NUfmiSdVrn6echI). 

*Anyway again*, at The Verge I'm still reviewing a ton of stuff, making YouTube videos, and writing a [newsletter called *Processor*](https://www.theverge.com/processor-newsletter-dieter-bohn-show-video) -- both about consumer technology. I also co-host The Vergecast along with Nilay Patel. 

I'll be answering questions from 12:30ET to 2:30 ET (give or take). Ask me anything!","[AMA] I'm Dieter Bohn, Executive Editor at The Verge. Ask Me Anything!"

In Canada, I'm on a Family Plan and the link informed me my account wasn't eligible.

I contacted support using [this](https://support.google.com/store/gethelp) link and they told me I needed to be signed up as a Stadia Pro subscriber, so I did so using the 1mo trial. I then waited patiently on chat hold for about 1h and spoke with the Stadia team, who confirmed my Stadia membership and YT Premium status.

The next day an agent called and while on the phone with me, sent me a link that let me redeem the offer successfully. Note that only the *Clearly White* bundle was offered with no option to change it (not sure if others were able to use a code to claim whatever color they wanted - my link was a direct shopping cart link tied to my email address)

Hope this helps other Canadians or others internationally in a similar situation!","[PSA] - Free Stadia Bundle ""Account Not Eligible"" Fix"

79,Android,"So as most of you know, Google has been struggling with the sharing interface for many versions now. One of their major focuses in Android Q/10 was improving the speed at which this interface triggered (primarily due to poor caching behaviours), and further tweaked for Android 11 

However, while the new menu/interface loads much more quickly, the inconsistencies of what options lie therein seem even more confusing..

Sharing URLs or products from Chrome suggest contacts in Messages (Default Text app), Telegram, or WhatsApp, but never those that are current or even recent - If I'm having a conversation with someone, switch to Chrome to look something up that's related to our chat, then hit share, that conversation should be one of the first couple suggestions, but it never seems to be the case.. This then forces users to scroll through the list of apps to find the one they want alphabetically, then choose a contact from there

I don't really understand the reasoning or design behind this interface.. The fact that it suggests random people on random platforms (I've had it recommend sending an Instagram contact a private message when I last used it over a month prior) - is there a better way to set this up to work efficiently, or some wayo to control what and who are suggested?",Let's talk about the Android Share Menu/Interface

That being said, I'm getting tired of these skinny phones, I miss my 16:9 Nexus 6, with how it managed to have good real state while not being too tall and easy to reach with my fingers

I get I'm a strange use case, but there are NONE of these on the market anymore: the last 16:9 one I can recall is the iPhone 8, and the smaller Pixel 2, which is super tiny. Even Xiaomi hasn't made any and they make a phone every week.

More importantly, mobile tech has shaken out of its mid-decade slump and gotten much more exciting with the advent of [foldable phones](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwd8abTO4vh3FQQrjgjxPHkJLiL4BS39h), swinging phones, rollable phones, and so on.

59,Android,"So as most of you know, Google phased out Google Play Music and they are forcing everyone to go on YouTube Music. I

I personally used the transferring tool to transfer my playlists and while the tool was not 100% accurate it transferred almost everything. And I personally understand that it is not possible to make the automatic tool to be perfect. Furthermore I noticed that there are some songs that were available on Google Play music but not on YouTube music.

However, the thing that is frustrating me the most is that YouTube music is broken on Android Auto and more specifically is that when you select to shuffle your playlist, next time you connect your phone the shuffle will be deselected. Furthermore, according to some other people reporting similar issues, the shuffle option only works for about 20 songs and then it just get deselected. Btw this problem is not new as it has been [reported about a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/ds1g83/youtube_music_shuffle_play_with_aa/)

It is really stupid from Google to force to use a service that it is not ready. If you wanna to have people test your product offer incentives. Honestly, the only thing that keeps me from not going to Spotify is the ad free experience from YouTube but I don't know how many more compromises I feel like doing.",Let's talk about Android Auto and YouTube Music

73,Android,"I still remember when the first Android was released. How it was doing things different than Apple and the users had choice and more control. It kept evolving and it was great. Even OEMs were introducing their own improvements looking to differentiate. Yet, slowly, but steady, fragmentation started to grow. OEMs started to not include all features from Android Vanilla which in some cases are great. Vendors started to more and more pack their phones with adware and bloatware. Updates were less and less frequent. Prices kept going up and up.

I was the guy that rooted my phones, unlocked the bootloader so I could try the latest Paranoid Android release and keep my phone with the latest Android version. Yet, things slowly started to change. Rooting became harder, unlocking bootloader would blow the efuses, phone functionalities would be lost, there's a higher risk of bricking your device. Priority now was ads on Android. And to top it all, Android OS fragmentation is crazy high these days.

My last android was a Galxy S8. Love most of it. Great camera, nice screen, IP6x, and a bunch of other nice things. Didn't like the price, that in EU you can't get Snapdragon, the curved display, and that once Samsung released a new device, mine was just old history for them. They also introduced new features that the S8 is more than capable to run, but artificially blocked them for only the new devices. 

While my S8 works quite well, it was losing out on new Android features and even on some Samsung features. I started doing my research to see if I would go for another Samsung, a Moto, Sony or even a 1+ or Pixel. Then I started to see the trend in prices, trying to match iPhone prices. I was ""WTF? Price is one of the benefits of buying Android"". Then I started to see how more bloatware was pushed into your device that you can't delete. Ads being pushed into your device from official OEM apps where no ad should ever be there. Android kept making questionable choices in how data was being managed and how Android worked in the background. Yet I kept looking. I mean, iOS? Why the fuck. Them with their walled garden bullshit.  Then I gifted my mum a pair of Galaxy Buds+. She had a borderline mid range phone, but with the minimum specs that should have allowed for the earphones to work. Nope, nothing. OK, it was not new and it was not Samsung. She went and bought a mid range Samsung. It connected, but there were some issues. Then she wanted to change the audio balance. I told her where to go and how to do it. Nothing... Nada. My brother had a go and could not find such option. Me thinking they were useless took on the task of showing them ho2 it was set. Nope, the setting is just not there. Then WhatsApp calls can't be answered with the Bud+. You have to answer the call from the phone and then hit the Bluetooth do the call would move to the Bluetooth. I also have the Bud+ and have the same issue. I also bought an Amazfit  smart watch that kept sending who knows what to some Chinese IP addresses. The app was invasive AF as well as not very reliable. Then I met my kids iphones. Everything changed.

They had only the iPhone 6s, very old. Just recently it got the iOS 14 update. Since a birthday was coming I decided to gift them an Apple Watch. Again, another epiphany. Got the thing out of the box and right away it asked to be paired with the 6s. Just like magic. No apps to set, no fumbling with settings. Once you say yes, it is just a matter of pointing the camera to some swirling dots and everything else is automatic or answering accept. I got right away why people buy Apple. It's just hassle free. For sure there must be issues I'm not aware, but as a person that works with technology since early age, I've never experienced anything like that. Then I played a bit with iOS. Then read a bit. The things I was looking for in a phone were all there: integration, security, privacy and functionality. I decided to make the jump and wow, it's hard to compare. I won't make this post any longer. The reason of posting it here is because I'm very sad Android is going in the direction it's going and Google keeps promising they would fix fragmentation and updates and support and a bunch of other things, but all they keep doing is add a feature to then take it or change it to make it almost useless and then bring it in some half baked for on some new OS version. There are things I would never be able to replace like Tasker or Reddit Is Fun, but what I've gained is far more valuable. I sure hope Android goes back to when it was exiting and may go back to it in the future, but I can't be bothered to pay a lot of money for an Android flagship that misses the mark on a bunch of stuff when I can buy an iPhone for the same or cheaper (never thought I would write those words) and have equal or better functionality while having more privacy, better integration between apps and more support.",Why Android and the phone manufacturers that use it pushed me to iOS
