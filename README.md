# Overview
In this project we pull our data from Reddit to use NLP/Sentiment analysis and Classification models on two separate subreddit columns.

# Problem Statement
A software company would like to develop a photo and video editing software for mobile phones, but can only produce it for one mobile phone operating system due to financial constraints.
Determine which mobile phone OS (iPhone or Android) this company should develop their app for purely based on Reddit posts under each platformâ€™s subreddit category.
