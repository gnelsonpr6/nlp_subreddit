2. When taking a picture with the camera app in the messaging app, black screen with spinning wheel appears for a few seconds and picture never ends up being taken.

Does anyone have any suggestions is my battery faulty as there is no way it should drain like this. i’ve always had iPhones so I know how battery’s get after a while but this is honestly ridiculous.

It’s not so much of a problem at the minute as. I have chargers at the only 2 places i go due to lockdown home and work. My concern will be when things return to normal and I start going on days off that the phone will basically be useless.

54,iphone,"I’m going to preface this commentary with the disclosure that I am an Apple fan, and I’m typing this on my iPhone X (November 2017). 

The current iPhones—the 12 series—were redesigned, and brought back to a virtually identical geometry to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 series of devices. This redesign is objectively worse in innumerable ways, and I’ll detail each respectively. 

In November 2017 Apple released the best physical iPhone design in materials and geometric shape, they have ever made, up to this date. The iPhone X, while geometrically identical to the iPhones since 2014, added a stainless steel band, and a glossy rear-glass panel. It was the first and only iPhone I have used without a case, and I’m still using this same iPhone without a case, because it was the first iPhone that had material design that offered grip (outside of the original few and the 5C). Aluminum and matte glass are both far more slippery, and disable the user from using the device without a case because the probability of dropping it is categorically increased.  

The following year Apple released the iPhone XS, which was still great in terms of materials and geometry, but due to the inclusive of LTE improvements they redesigned the antenna bands such that it now had asymmetric bands and this could be visually seen in the band separations. Moreover, speaker holes on the bottom of the device also became asymmetric due to this change. With this asymmetry, the device was physically worse than the iPhone X, but still fine. 

In 2019 Apple released the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. The iPhone 11 used an aluminum band which is astronomically more slippery than glossy stainless steal, which made this device virtually unusable without a case. Again, far worse than the iPhone X. The iPhone 11 Pro was switched to a matte rear-glass panel which had two extreme drawbacks: it was categorically more slippery, and it feels far worse than glossy glass to the touch. Again, this device virtually assures that users put a case back on their iPhone because it has a far more slippery material design, and it feels gritty to the touch, rather than extremely smooth. I also want to point out that the intention was to reduce the appearance of scratches and smudges on the back of the device... this is an inherently flawed and ironic logic because in so doing, they increased the slipperiness of the device by an enormous amount, and guaranteed that users place it in a case, thereby nullifying the scratch and smudge resistance gained. You design for comfort and the ability to hold the device without a case, that takes precedence over all. Again, this device is far worse than the iPhone X. 

In 2020 Apple just recently released the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro series of devices. Now, Apple has switched back to a completely squared edge, and completely flat glass. Let me break down each reason why this is astronomically inferior design, and they should at worst, reintroduce the symmetric, rounded design alongside the square design.","A Report On Why iPhone 12 Series Devices Are Terrible, Comparatively"

I turned it off again and removed the sim card slot to check the water damage indicator, and it's completely untouched. 

Should I be worried? Should I put it back in some rice, give it a few days? Am I completely fucked? Is it possible to just get water underneath the screen without damaging the insides?

4,iphone,Hey. So apparently I’m 10 years old and my parents decided to put screen time on my phone (I’m 15 btw). I know how this sounds so cringy but please keep reading. I’d say I understand iOS as an operation software pretty well and I have tried every possible way to get the passcode. The thing is that I don’t want to change the password I just wanna find out what it is. So after my useless tries to get the passcode I started googling how to get it. I found a pretty cool website and tool called [pinfinder.](https://pinfinder.dot)net For a sec I thought I found a way how to actually get the passcode but pinfinder only works up to iOS 12.4. I think you can’t really get the passcode just using only your phone because iOS is just too safe. So please if you know about any tools like pinfinder let me know.,Is there a way to get your screen time passcode?

91,iphone,"I noticed that with some friends who have iPhones, the first messsage I send from my iPhone sends as SMS.  If I send another message right after, it sends as iMessage.  It's as if my phone doesn't ""know"" the contact has an iPhone until it sends the SMS.  This doesn't happen with all of my iPhone-owning contacts.  Does anyone know why this happens?",Just switched from Android to iPhone. The first message from my phone sends to some iPhone owners sends as a text message (then iMessage thenceforth)
92,iphone,"So guys I want to buy the iPhone xr but unfortunately I couldn't hold one in hand nor was I able to hold the X so I can't possibly imagin the deference in screens both of them offers
Ofcorse all of us know the obvious defrences between bother of them cpu,screen,battery so it's a straight forward comparison but since I couldn't test such core aspects without owning the phone I thought it will be right to ask those who spent the most time with it and will be the most honest.
So if you please can you tell me what I will be messing on with both options and if it's worth it in your opinion and why? 
Thanks in advance.",Is the xr still worth it today ???!

94,iphone,"But I am aiming for a very specific question - so I hope that it's still ok :)

Hi everyone,

End of August I got my first Apple product from work (macbook pro). Before that I was a firm believer that Apple product overpriced and for swag use only, but god how wrong I was - I SIMPLY LOVED IT. A few weeks later I got the AirPods pro and LOVED THEM as well. So now when the time comes and I need to upgrade my phone, after thinking about it for a while (using android from 2012) I decided to complete the switch and buy an iPhone :O

Currently I am using a Huawei Honor 7x (lame I know).

There are 2 things which I care about in my future phone, both are very travel oriented:

1. **Battery** \- I love a big battery. When travelling, in many cases I find myself waking up in the morning, spending the entire day hiking/walking etc using the phone to navigate, taking pictures, read stuff online and etc, and then in the evening entering a night bus, using the phone periodically thoughout the night, and then arriving at the destination in the morning needing some remaining juice in the battery to calmly find my hostel/hotel.
2. **Camera** \- I want it to be very very good as a point and shoot camera. I don't edit my photos afterwads.

Now, obviously the MAX is better for both of these. The question is - by how much? Is the photo quality on the max actually noticable?

My worry about the MAX is the size. I am not a small person (almost 1.90, around 6.2 in US measures), and my current phone is 156.5 x 75.3 x 7.6 mm which is not that far from the pro max's 160.84 x 78.09 x 7.39 mm and I am just fine with using it with a single hand, but the max is even bigger, and I am woudering if the camera and battery are worth the size.

Any opinions?

Thanks!",Yet another iPhone 12 pro or pro max threat :(

Recently I forgot I hadn't wiped my old phone, and all my texts were going through to it (RCS texts), so I couldn't send any messages from my iPhone, and I wondered why. 

I decided to factory reset my Android after moving my stuff, which automatically disables RCS. I had to reset tho because even though I disabled RCS in my settings, it didn't fully deactivate.

Randomly remembered that I had factory reset it, and lo and behold, I was activated with iMessage within 10 seconds.

TLDR: If you're moving from Android, either factory reset your phone or disable RCS (chat features). It somehow fucked with my iMessage activation.",Moving from Android to iPhone? Great! Disable RCS.

23,iphone,"One of the things that i like about the new iPhone 12 is the MagSafe, however, its not worth it for me to upgrade from my current iPhone Xs max. I was hoping to find a MagSafe case that have built in magnets for older iPhones, so i can mount my iPhone in my car with a wireless charger car mount, but couldn’t fine any. 

I however, found MagSafe magnets membrane and a wireless charger car mount that is compatible with with MagSafe in AliExpress:

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001698659539.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.678f4c4dRobbu4

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001661427276.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.678f4c4dRobbu4

I ordered them and got them today. I tried to tape the MagSafe magnet membrane to the external side of my iPhone cover, and then attach the MagSafe wireless charger. It was charging fine, but I haven’t testing the charging speed yet; theoretically, it should charge the iPhone with 7.5 W; But as you can see in the video below, it looks ugly and the tape won’t stick to the cover. I might try to glue the membrane to the cover, however, ideally i want the MagSafe to be hidden inside the cover. I will try to contact Chinese case suppliers to see if they can make MagSafe cases for older iPhones.

30,iphone,"Since my I noticed my phone wouldn't charge properly with my Anker wireless charger, I did some digging and found out that this has something to do with the magnet placement on the new iPhones, and people reported that a few workarounds include placing the phone horizontally on the stand or lifting it about 1cm higher. Since the second option is what worked for me, that made me think this a hardware issue that can't be fixed with a software update.

Other people, however, have reported being able to fix the problem simply by updating the software or restarting the phone, which makes me think that this something that could potentially be solved in a future software update. Although these did not work for me.

So my question is: is there a possibility a future software update will fix this so that I don't have to charge my phone with a pencil underneath it, or should I just accept it already and just get a new wireless charger that works for my iPhone 12 Pro?",Is there a chance the wireless Qi charging issues with the iPhone 12 Pro could be fixed with a software update?

Considering a refurbished Apple is not getting one for cheap but it is a smart choice, first of, by saving money which costs one-third of the price of the purchasing brand new items. And also ecologically responsible choice with the reuse and recycling that helps in environment impact.  

&amp;#x200B;

![video](3f7d02nc5y061)

**What to consider in buying refurbished Apple?**

The first issue is to figure out what you wanted; an upgraded RAM or CPU or SSD you need to wait until one of those appears in the online Apple store or authorized store for refurb devices, and buy it immediately, which many do not hesitate in considering a refurb one. Which is way more cheaper than the new one and as good as something brand new.

Most refurbished will be based on models, likely with the minimal RAM: phones or iPads or MacBooks.

**Where to buy refurbished Apple products?**

Apple.com don’t sell refurbished products in store, however they do online just visit the site.

And other authorized parties

**Gazelle**

**SellYourMac**

**Tradeamac**

These stores does not only sells refurbished devices but also trad-ins. Offers a trade in with your old devices to a new model.  It depends on the country though as not all countries can offer this but tradeamac in Canada does, also they  buy all new, used, refurbished, unwanted, broken Apple products for a fair rice, which typically pays higher than the others.

**Where is the cheapest place to find refurbished Apple products in Canada?**

[**https://www.facebook.com/tradeamaccanada**](https://www.facebook.com/tradeamaccanada)**,** which they do buy bulks or an overstock devices.

If you didn't get a verification email please check your spam, it has been going to spam weirdly

Also here's a short video of how it works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXS3HOB\_Ja8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab\_channel=ChaiTheApp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXS3HOB_Ja8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=ChaiTheApp) (the asthethics are not up to date in the video but the way it works is)

I'd love to get feedback - tweet me @ chaitheapp on twitter or you can just leave a review on the app page.

If you care about why I made it:

So basically I graduated from college this summer and moved to a new city for my job. I'm pretty much completely alone in this new city and it's basically impossible to make new friends right now because of the whole pandemic situation. Let's just say my mental health has not been great and I have felt pretty overwhelmed and not really sure how to fix anything.

A lot of times I felt like I just wanted to talk to someone about something to feel better but it's really hard to reach out to people because it feels like they're still living their lives and don't have time for you. This app is essentially just a way to reach out to anyone and have a random conversation about anything so that you can talk about your problems or anything that makes life feel just a bit more normal.

Thanks for reading!

The limiting factor here is the screen's width which is 1080 pixels. Therefore the corresponding length is 1080 \* 16 / 9 = 1920 pixels. With a resolution of  476 pixels per inch, we get a length of 4.03 inches and a width of 2.27 inches. Thus we get for the diagonal
