Does anyone have any suggestions is my battery faulty as there is no way it should drain like this. i’ve always had iPhones so I know how battery’s get after a while but this is honestly ridiculous.

It’s not so much of a problem at the minute as. I have chargers at the only 2 places i go due to lockdown home and work. My concern will be when things return to normal and I start going on days off that the phone will basically be useless.

iOS 14 adds a new App Library view for organizing all of your apps. Apps are automatically organized in the App Library, and you don’t have to keep all of the icons on your actual home screen view. There is also a new list view as well as features for sorting applications based on usage and more.

### Widgets

iOS 14 adds widgets to the home screen of the iPhone and iPad for the first time. Widgets are more data-rich than ever and come in a variety of sizes. Apps move out of the way automatically to make room for the widgets. You access these widgets through the “Widget Gallery,” with multiple different sizing options.

### Picture in Picture on iPhone

iOS 14 also provides support for picture in picture, works very similar to the iPad experience. Meanwhile, Siri has a new interface that does not overtake the entire screen.",iOS 14 New Features

99,iphone," 

Hi !

I can't find other cases like me so I'm trying here.

After 3 weeks using my 12 pro max, I witnessed that the shiny layer on my notification switch was showing weird marks.

It has been noticed by my Apple Center, I've been contacted by an employee (after sending pics of the issue), this person agreed that it was not acceptable due to the fact that the phone was brand new and that my usage was not the source of the paint issue, but... nothing could be done.

I'm ok that it's not a blocking issue, but it could have been a deal-breaker for me. I'm not spending 1350€ for a phone where the paint is peeling off after 3 weeks of very soft usage.

What are your thoughts ?

Thanks a lot and sorry for the English, french here :)

I don't mind the people who just want the high end just because but I was wondering what are some practical uses that enables people to need to use all their ram or their camera or what uses do they need for hundreds of gigs of storage or a highly upgraded 120hz screen.

Who's paying over a thousand dollars to constantly use their phones for playing games? Who pays that much to need the camera systems provided in a phone compared to a camera?

Setting aside ecosystems and buying it because it's high end what are some practical situations that would require someone to buy a high end phone for its specs?

I just want to reiterate that this is speculation and not a rant on people with those types of phones as I also like to indulge on getting phones that provide me more than I need for daily use. This is just a question I wanted to ask to see If I can get some repsonse and start a discussion on this topic.",What are some uses or what type of people actually need the high spec phones?

30,iphone,"I’m going to preface this commentary with the disclosure that I am an Apple fan, and I’m typing this on my iPhone X (November 2017). 

The current iPhones—the 12 series—were redesigned, and brought back to a virtually identical geometry to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 series of devices. This redesign is objectively worse in innumerable ways, and I’ll detail each respectively. 

In November 2017 Apple released the best physical iPhone design in materials and geometric shape, they have ever made, up to this date. The iPhone X, while geometrically identical to the iPhones since 2014, added a stainless steel band, and a glossy rear-glass panel. It was the first and only iPhone I have used without a case, and I’m still using this same iPhone without a case, because it was the first iPhone that had material design that offered grip (outside of the original few and the 5C). Aluminum and matte glass are both far more slippery, and disable the user from using the device without a case because the probability of dropping it is categorically increased.  

The following year Apple released the iPhone XS, which was still great in terms of materials and geometry, but due to the inclusive of LTE improvements they redesigned the antenna bands such that it now had asymmetric bands and this could be visually seen in the band separations. Moreover, speaker holes on the bottom of the device also became asymmetric due to this change. With this asymmetry, the device was physically worse than the iPhone X, but still fine. 

In 2019 Apple released the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. The iPhone 11 used an aluminum band which is astronomically more slippery than glossy stainless steal, which made this device virtually unusable without a case. Again, far worse than the iPhone X. The iPhone 11 Pro was switched to a matte rear-glass panel which had two extreme drawbacks: it was categorically more slippery, and it feels far worse than glossy glass to the touch. Again, this device virtually assures that users put a case back on their iPhone because it has a far more slippery material design, and it feels gritty to the touch, rather than extremely smooth. I also want to point out that the intention was to reduce the appearance of scratches and smudges on the back of the device... this is an inherently flawed and ironic logic because in so doing, they increased the slipperiness of the device by an enormous amount, and guaranteed that users place it in a case, thereby nullifying the scratch and smudge resistance gained. You design for comfort and the ability to hold the device without a case, that takes precedence over all. Again, this device is far worse than the iPhone X. 

In 2020 Apple just recently released the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro series of devices. Now, Apple has switched back to a completely squared edge, and completely flat glass. Let me break down each reason why this is astronomically inferior design, and they should at worst, reintroduce the symmetric, rounded design alongside the square design.","A Report On Why iPhone 12 Series Devices Are Terrible, Comparatively"

3.) Take one of the airpods out of your ear. This will pause the iPhone sound.

4.) Put it back in and sound will move from iPhone to Mac.

39,iphone,"3 Months ago I purchased an iPhone after using Samsung phones for a long time. I made a post in here about my new adventure and some of the things that I would miss from Android and some of the things I was looking forward to in iOS. 

Here are my thoughts after 3 months of use.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I still miss from Android:**

* Always on Display. (I thought apple would introduce this on iPhone 12, with all models being OLED)
* Android Gboard keyboard (The layout, prediction and auto-correct is way better on Android)
* Chrome on Android is way better.
* Face ID is ok, I still prefer the fingerprint sensor. (Sometimes it doesn't recognize my face and brings up the pin screen and when I'm about to enter the pin it suddenly recognizes me and unlocks. Happens maybe 30% of the time)
* Still haven't found a calendar app/widget like the Samsung calendar widget. [Here is a screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/swvNstf/Screenshot-20200922-105227-One-UI-Home.jpg)
* I miss the Android notifications system. (Paired with AOD)
* File system/Folders. iOS combines all pictures from messages, whatsapp, messenger, camera, chrome downloads. I sincerely hate this. Is there a workaround to save pictures from certain apps to specific folders?

&amp;#x200B;

**Things that are better than Android:**

* Almost all the apps are better and more polished on iOS
* Even at 60hz its very smooth and no lag or stutter. (Which I used to experience on brand new Samsung phones)
* More app availability. (But still no Dark Sky in Canada)
* iMessage, My contacts use a mix of whatsapp, Messenger, and iMessages. Now I can be part of iMessage groups too.

**Things I still need help with or finding apps:**

* Well one is still the Calendar widget
* Is there a replacement for pushbullet yet? I used to send a lot of pictures from my laptop to my Android phone using pushbullet. It was so easy too. while I was browsing Reddit or something I would right click on the image and click ""send to my phone"". It would be on my phone. Is there anything like this for windows?

My biggest gripe was that I would miss the ""back"" gesture/button from Android. For the first couple of weeks It was hard to get used to not having a back button, but after three months. I only miss it like 10% of the time. I've gotten used to iOS gestures pretty easily.

One of the things I found out that hitting the power button ends the call. If I was on speaker phone, I would always hit the power button to turn off the screen on my Galaxies but I wasn't aware that on iPhones it ends the call. I thought I was dropping the calls, until it hit me lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I would probably stick with iPhone for now and maybe even the 13 if it has major changes.","Follow up after 3 months of iOS use (OP: Almost 10 years Android user, finally switched over to an iPhone 11 Pro.)"

59,iphone,"So as the title says I’ve recently gotten the brand new 2020 iPhone SE but as I’ve seen it when I first unboxed it that no one has really talked about is that since when the phone first came out they have removed both the power brick and the AirPods effectively making the box smaller. I am slightly disappointed in Apple because they’re still selling the same phone at the same price and remove the things from the box and no one‘s even talking about it because everyone has already reviewed it. I mean it’s not like I was going to use the power brick either, I had a 12 watt one from a previous device but I still think that they shouldn’t have change the design of the box. Who knows they might’ve even done this with the iPhone XR. I mean I’m not really in the qualifications to criticize Apple for a change in the box of the iPhone SE because this is my very first iPhone and smart phone that I have owned. So I’m not saying I hate the phone I absolutely love it it’s one of the apples best iPhones that they have ever made I absolutely love the new SE and I’m going to keep this phone even when I upgraded if I am able to, I just don’t think that they should’ve changed the box design even even though the phone has been out for months, I don’t know when they changed it because I have very very recently got this phone and I was surprised that they have change the design. I get that the phone probably costs a lot to manufacture but still I really don’t think that they should have changed the did the box design and removing the power brick, the EarPods and changing the cable to a type C it’s only people who have bought the iPhone 11 or 12 can use the cable with their power brick otherwise people will have to buy their own.","So I got the new 2020 iphone SE, and I’m slightly disappointed"

I get home and the display screen looks like there's water underneath it. Great. I turn it off and put it in some rice. Today, the water has moved around, but the phone was still working. I turned it off again and removed the sim card slot to check the water damage indicator, and it's completely untouched. 

Should I be worried? Should I put it back in some rice, give it a few days? Am I completely fucked? Is it possible to just get water underneath the screen without damaging the insides?

23,iphone,Hey. So apparently I’m 10 years old and my parents decided to put screen time on my phone (I’m 15 btw). I know how this sounds so cringy but please keep reading. I’d say I understand iOS as an operation software pretty well and I have tried every possible way to get the passcode. The thing is that I don’t want to change the password I just wanna find out what it is. So after my useless tries to get the passcode I started googling how to get it. I found a pretty cool website and tool called [pinfinder.](https://pinfinder.dot)net For a sec I thought I found a way how to actually get the passcode but pinfinder only works up to iOS 12.4. I think you can’t really get the passcode just using only your phone because iOS is just too safe. So please if you know about any tools like pinfinder let me know.,Is there a way to get your screen time passcode?

Correlated words are dancing, twisting, and swimming throughout the screen. With this unique method, the relations of words will penetrate into your memory slowly and spontaneously.

92,iphone,"It’s been two years since we introduced a megathread system as an attempt to curb support request self-posts flooding this subreddit. It has served its purpose well for the most part. However, we do realise that by stuffing all the people looking for help into one post - many people weren’t getting the help they needed in a timely fashion, if at all. We tried different ways of getting more people to help out giving answers in the support megathread, [such as attempting to reach out to current/former Genius Bar employees](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/eydut6/daily_tech_support_thread_flairs/), and reaching out to people that seem well-versed in helping other users out with their iPhone/iOS issues. Unfortunately we didn’t receive much interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Today the mod team has  decided  on  a  change  to  the  support  system,  which we will be trialling over the next 2-3 weeks.  **Starting from 8am EST today (15/12/2020)**, the Daily Tech Support thread will be deactivated and all support requests will instead be redirected to either r/iOS (for  software  related  issues),  or  r/applehelp (for  hardware  issues).  Users  will  be  allowed  to  make  a  self-post  (not  in  a  megathread!)  asking  for  help  with  their  issue,  granted  they  detail  their  issue  properly.  These changes will be reflected in our rules and removal reasons.  

&amp;#x200B;

You may be asking why we are making these changes:

&amp;#x200B;

**(1)** Well, as stated at the beginning of this post, we realise that oftentimes people weren’t getting their issues responded to in a timely fashion, if they ever even received an answer. By allowing users to make their own post detailing the issue they need help with - their issue will gain more visibility which increases the chance of their issue being seen and resolved. 

**(2)** By the tech support thread being removed, we will be freeing up a sticky spot which we can use for other megathreads (such as a photography megathread, app discovery megathread, etc), or for simple announcements. 

*(We’ll be looking into possibly adding on to this new system  by having a bot that can flair a post as “Resolved” when the OP of the support post replies to a user with a solution that worked for them by using a special command like !resolved.)*

&amp;#x200B;

We’ll monitor these changes and come back after the new year and discuss as a mod team. We may also call a community vote to see if they liked the changes or not. This is merely a trial, so nothing is set in stone yet. No harm in trying different options! Of course, people should really be going to Apple Support for their issues, but we do acknowledge that may not be an option all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, this may be the last mod post from us until the new year. I’d like to extend a massive thank you to everyone on the mod team who’s been volunteering their time this year to make this a safe and enjoyable community for iPhone fans from every corner of the globe, and also a huge thanks to all  our  users.  It’s amazing to see this community so close to 3 MILLION users! On  behalf  of  the  r/iPhone mod  team,  we  wish  you  a  well  deserved  holiday,  and  a  healthy  and  happy  new  year!",IMPORTANT: Changes to the Support System on r/iPhone.

59,iphone,"But I am aiming for a very specific question - so I hope that it's still ok :)

Hi everyone,

End of August I got my first Apple product from work (macbook pro). Before that I was a firm believer that Apple product overpriced and for swag use only, but god how wrong I was - I SIMPLY LOVED IT. A few weeks later I got the AirPods pro and LOVED THEM as well. So now when the time comes and I need to upgrade my phone, after thinking about it for a while (using android from 2012) I decided to complete the switch and buy an iPhone :O

Currently I am using a Huawei Honor 7x (lame I know).

There are 2 things which I care about in my future phone, both are very travel oriented:

1. **Battery** \- I love a big battery. When travelling, in many cases I find myself waking up in the morning, spending the entire day hiking/walking etc using the phone to navigate, taking pictures, read stuff online and etc, and then in the evening entering a night bus, using the phone periodically thoughout the night, and then arriving at the destination in the morning needing some remaining juice in the battery to calmly find my hostel/hotel.
2. **Camera** \- I want it to be very very good as a point and shoot camera. I don't edit my photos afterwads.

Now, obviously the MAX is better for both of these. The question is - by how much? Is the photo quality on the max actually noticable?

My worry about the MAX is the size. I am not a small person (almost 1.90, around 6.2 in US measures), and my current phone is 156.5 x 75.3 x 7.6 mm which is not that far from the pro max's 160.84 x 78.09 x 7.39 mm and I am just fine with using it with a single hand, but the max is even bigger, and I am woudering if the camera and battery are worth the size.

Any opinions?

Thanks!",Yet another iPhone 12 pro or pro max threat :(

61,iphone,"Hey everyone. I realized the 12 is having some display issues, and Apple thinks they can fix this through a software update. 

Should I wait until this update is released to buy the 12? I wouldn't want to risk getting getting stuck with a defective phone that can't be fixed with a software update. A couple Qs to inform this decision - 

1. Are we confident that this is fixable with a software update? 
2. Does anyone have a guess as to when Apple will try to release this update? 
3. Would Apple care cover replacing the phone if it's not a software issue? 
4. Are a large number of phones suffering from this problem to begin with? 

Any insight here is helpful.",Should I wait to buy 12 until after display issue is fixed?

Recently I forgot I hadn't wiped my old phone, and all my texts were going through to it (RCS texts), so I couldn't send any messages from my iPhone, and I wondered why. 

I decided to factory reset my Android after moving my stuff, which automatically disables RCS. I had to reset tho because even though I disabled RCS in my settings, it didn't fully deactivate.

Randomly remembered that I had factory reset it, and lo and behold, I was activated with iMessage within 10 seconds.

TLDR: If you're moving from Android, either factory reset your phone or disable RCS (chat features). It somehow fucked with my iMessage activation.",Moving from Android to iPhone? Great! Disable RCS.

57,iphone,"One of the things that i like about the new iPhone 12 is the MagSafe, however, its not worth it for me to upgrade from my current iPhone Xs max. I was hoping to find a MagSafe case that have built in magnets for older iPhones, so i can mount my iPhone in my car with a wireless charger car mount, but couldn’t fine any. 

I however, found MagSafe magnets membrane and a wireless charger car mount that is compatible with with MagSafe in AliExpress:

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001698659539.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.678f4c4dRobbu4

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001661427276.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.678f4c4dRobbu4

I ordered them and got them today. I tried to tape the MagSafe magnet membrane to the external side of my iPhone cover, and then attach the MagSafe wireless charger. It was charging fine, but I haven’t testing the charging speed yet; theoretically, it should charge the iPhone with 7.5 W; But as you can see in the video below, it looks ugly and the tape won’t stick to the cover. I might try to glue the membrane to the cover, however, ideally i want the MagSafe to be hidden inside the cover. I will try to contact Chinese case suppliers to see if they can make MagSafe cases for older iPhones.

Since the second option is what worked for me, that made me think this a hardware issue that can't be fixed with a software update.

Other people, however, have reported being able to fix the problem simply by updating the software or restarting the phone, which makes me think that this something that could potentially be solved in a future software update. Although these did not work for me.

So my question is: is there a possibility a future software update will fix this so that I don't have to charge my phone with a pencil underneath it, or should I just accept it already and just get a new wireless charger that works for my iPhone 12 Pro?",Is there a chance the wireless Qi charging issues with the iPhone 12 Pro could be fixed with a software update?
