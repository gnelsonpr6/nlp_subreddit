But it seems that Apple have a better system on a chip than Android phones and have better cooling.

So can a 4K 60fps capable iPhone record 4K 60fps for 1 hour or more without the recording stopping itself due to overheating? I want to know for recording things like exchanging presents on Christmas day, etc. Do you get 60fps throughout the recording or are some frames dropped?

I leave for work on a morning on 100% and for example it‚Äôs dinner time now and i‚Äôm down to 35% batter with only 1h17 mins of screen on time - barely used it at all.

Does anyone have any suggestions is my battery faulty as there is no way it should drain like this. i‚Äôve always had iPhones so I know how battery‚Äôs get after a while but this is honestly ridiculous.

It‚Äôs not so much of a problem at the minute as. I have chargers at the only 2 places i go due to lockdown home and work. My concern will be when things return to normal and I start going on days off that the phone will basically be useless.

Is anyone else having similar issues or any suggestions would be much appreciated.

iOS 14 adds a new App Library view for organizing all of your apps. Apps are automatically organized in the App Library, and you don‚Äôt have to keep all of the icons on your actual home screen view. There is also a new list view as well as features for sorting applications based on usage and more.

### Widgets

iOS 14 adds widgets to the home screen of the iPhone and iPad for the first time.¬†Widgets are more data-rich than ever and come in a variety of sizes. Apps move out of the way automatically to make room for the widgets. You access these widgets through the ‚ÄúWidget Gallery,‚Äù with multiple different sizing options.

Hi !

I can't find other cases like me so I'm trying here.

After 3 weeks using my 12 pro max, I witnessed that the shiny layer on my notification switch was showing weird marks.

It has been noticed by my Apple Center, I've been contacted by an employee (after sending pics of the issue), this person agreed that it was not acceptable due to the fact that the phone was brand new and that my usage was not the source of the paint issue, but... nothing could be done.

I'm ok that it's not a blocking issue, but it could have been a deal-breaker for me. I'm not spending 1350‚Ç¨ for a phone where the paint is peeling off after 3 weeks of very soft usage.

What are your thoughts ?

I don't mind the people who just want the high end just because but I was wondering what are some practical uses that enables people to need to use all their ram or their camera or what uses do they need for hundreds of gigs of storage or a highly upgraded 120hz screen.

Who's paying over a thousand dollars to constantly use their phones for playing games? Who pays that much to need the camera systems provided in a phone compared to a camera?

Setting aside ecosystems and buying it because it's high end what are some practical situations that would require someone to buy a high end phone for its specs?

I just want to reiterate that this is speculation and not a rant on people with those types of phones as I also like to indulge on getting phones that provide me more than I need for daily use.

2230,"A Report On Why iPhone 12 Series Devices Are Terrible, ComparativelyI‚Äôm going to preface this commentary with the disclosure that I am an Apple fan, and I‚Äôm typing this on my iPhone X (November 2017). 

The current iPhones‚Äîthe 12 series‚Äîwere redesigned, and brought back to a virtually identical geometry to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 series of devices. This redesign is objectively worse in innumerable ways, and I‚Äôll detail each respectively. 

In November 2017 Apple released the best physical iPhone design in materials and geometric shape, they have ever made, up to this date. The iPhone X, while geometrically identical to the iPhones since 2014, added a stainless steel band, and a glossy rear-glass panel. It was the first and only iPhone I have used without a case, and I‚Äôm still using this same iPhone without a case, because it was the first iPhone that had material design that offered grip (outside of the original few and the 5C). Aluminum and matte glass are both far more slippery, and disable the user from using the device without a case because the probability of dropping it is categorically increased.  

The following year Apple released the iPhone XS, which was still great in terms of materials and geometry, but due to the inclusive of LTE improvements they redesigned the antenna bands such that it now had asymmetric bands and this could be visually seen in the band separations. Moreover, speaker holes on the bottom of the device also became asymmetric due to this change. With this asymmetry, the device was physically worse than the iPhone X, but still fine. 

In 2019 Apple released the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. The iPhone 11 used an aluminum band which is astronomically more slippery than glossy stainless steal, which made this device virtually unusable without a case. Again, far worse than the iPhone X. The iPhone 11 Pro was switched to a matte rear-glass panel which had two extreme drawbacks: it was categorically more slippery, and it feels far worse than glossy glass to the touch. Again, this device virtually assures that users put a case back on their iPhone because it has a far more slippery material design, and it feels gritty to the touch, rather than extremely smooth. I also want to point out that the intention was to reduce the appearance of scratches and smudges on the back of the device... this is an inherently flawed and ironic logic because in so doing, they increased the slipperiness of the device by an enormous amount, and guaranteed that users place it in a case, thereby nullifying the scratch and smudge resistance gained. You design for comfort and the ability to hold the device without a case, that takes precedence over all. Again, this device is far worse than the iPhone X. 

In 2020 Apple just recently released the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro series of devices. Now, Apple has switched back to a completely squared edge, and completely flat glass. Let me break down each reason why this is astronomically inferior design, and they should at worst, reintroduce the symmetric, rounded design alongside the square design.",1

3.) Take one of the airpods out of your ear. This will pause the iPhone sound.

3039,"Follow up after 3 months of iOS use (OP: Almost 10 years Android user, finally switched over to an iPhone 11 Pro.)3 Months ago I purchased an iPhone after using Samsung phones for a long time. I made a post in here about my new adventure and some of the things that I would miss from Android and some of the things I was looking forward to in iOS. 

Here are my thoughts after 3 months of use.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I still miss from Android:**

* Always on Display. (I thought apple would introduce this on iPhone 12, with all models being OLED)
* Android Gboard keyboard (The layout, prediction and auto-correct is way better on Android)
* Chrome on Android is way better.
* Face ID is ok, I still prefer the fingerprint sensor. (Sometimes it doesn't recognize my face and brings up the pin screen and when I'm about to enter the pin it suddenly recognizes me and unlocks. Happens maybe 30% of the time)
* Still haven't found a calendar app/widget like the Samsung calendar widget. [Here is a screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/swvNstf/Screenshot-20200922-105227-One-UI-Home.jpg)
* I miss the Android notifications system. (Paired with AOD)
* File system/Folders. iOS combines all pictures from messages, whatsapp, messenger, camera, chrome downloads. I sincerely hate this. Is there a workaround to save pictures from certain apps to specific folders?

&amp;#x200B;

**Things that are better than Android:**

* Almost all the apps are better and more polished on iOS
* Even at 60hz its very smooth and no lag or stutter. (Which I used to experience on brand new Samsung phones)
* More app availability. (But still no Dark Sky in Canada)
* iMessage, My contacts use a mix of whatsapp, Messenger, and iMessages. Now I can be part of iMessage groups too.

**Things I still need help with or finding apps:**

* Well one is still the Calendar widget
* Is there a replacement for pushbullet yet? I used to send a lot of pictures from my laptop to my Android phone using pushbullet. It was so easy too. while I was browsing Reddit or something I would right click on the image and click ""send to my phone"". It would be on my phone. Is there anything like this for windows?

My biggest gripe was that I would miss the ""back"" gesture/button from Android. For the first couple of weeks It was hard to get used to not having a back button, but after three months. I only miss it like 10% of the time. I've gotten used to iOS gestures pretty easily.

One of the things I found out that hitting the power button ends the call. If I was on speaker phone, I would always hit the power button to turn off the screen on my Galaxies but I wasn't aware that on iPhones it ends the call. I thought I was dropping the calls, until it hit me lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I would probably stick with iPhone for now and maybe even the 13 if it has major changes.",1

3359,"So I got the new 2020 iphone SE, and I‚Äôm slightly disappointedSo as the title says I‚Äôve recently gotten the brand new 2020 iPhone SE but as I‚Äôve seen it when I first unboxed it that no one has really talked about is that since when the phone first came out they have removed both the power brick and the AirPods effectively making the box smaller. I am slightly disappointed in Apple because they‚Äôre still selling the same phone at the same price and remove the things from the box and no one‚Äòs even talking about it because everyone has already reviewed it. I mean it‚Äôs not like I was going to use the power brick either, I had a 12 watt one from a previous device but I still think that they shouldn‚Äôt have change the design of the box. Who knows they might‚Äôve even done this with the iPhone XR. I mean I‚Äôm not really in the qualifications to criticize Apple for a change in the box of the iPhone SE because this is my very first iPhone and smart phone that I have owned. So I‚Äôm not saying I hate the phone I absolutely love it it‚Äôs one of the apples best iPhones that they have ever made I absolutely love the new SE and I‚Äôm going to keep this phone even when I upgraded if I am able to, I just don‚Äôt think that they should‚Äôve changed the box design even even though the phone has been out for months, I don‚Äôt know when they changed it because I have very very recently got this phone and I was surprised that they have change the design. I get that the phone probably costs a lot to manufacture but still I really don‚Äôt think that they should have changed the did the box design and removing the power brick, the EarPods and changing the cable to a type C it‚Äôs only people who have bought the iPhone 11 or 12 can use the cable with their power brick otherwise people will have to buy their own.",1

I jumped in the pool at midnight and forgot my phone was in my pocket. Classic dumbass move. I got out immediately. It was still on and working, and that's when I learned that the iphone 8 has water resistance. Tight.

I get home and the display screen looks like there's water underneath it. Great. I turn it off and put it in some rice. Today, the water has moved around, but the phone was still working. I turned it off again and removed the sim card slot to check the water damage indicator, and it's completely untouched. 

Should I be worried? Should I put it back in some rice, give it a few days? Am I completely fucked? Is it possible to just get water underneath the screen without damaging the insides? Any help is appreciated!",1

I know how this sounds so cringy but please keep reading. I‚Äôd say I understand iOS as an operation software pretty well and I have tried every possible way to get the passcode. The thing is that I don‚Äôt want to change the password I just wanna find out what it is. So after my useless tries to get the passcode I started googling how to get it. I found a pretty cool website and tool called [pinfinder.](https://pinfinder.dot)net For a sec I thought I found a way how to actually get the passcode but pinfinder only works up to iOS 12.4. I think you can‚Äôt really get the passcode just using only your phone because iOS is just too safe. So please if you know about any tools like pinfinder let me know.,1

7392,"IMPORTANT: Changes to the Support System on r/iPhone.It‚Äôs been two years since we introduced a megathread system as an attempt to curb support request self-posts flooding this subreddit. It has served its purpose well for the most part. However, we do realise that by stuffing all the people looking for help into one post - many people weren‚Äôt getting the help they needed in a timely fashion, if at all. We tried different ways of getting more people to help out giving answers in the support megathread, [such as attempting to reach out to current/former Genius Bar employees](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/eydut6/daily_tech_support_thread_flairs/), and reaching out to people that seem well-versed in helping other users out with their iPhone/iOS issues. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt receive much interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Today the mod team has  decided  on  a  change  to  the  support  system,  which we will be trialling over the next 2-3 weeks.  **Starting from 8am EST today (15/12/2020)**, the Daily Tech Support thread will be deactivated and all support requests will instead be redirected to either r/iOS (for  software  related  issues),  or  r/applehelp (for  hardware  issues).  Users  will  be  allowed  to  make  a  self-post  (not  in  a  megathread!)  asking  for  help  with  their  issue,  granted  they  detail  their  issue  properly.  These changes will be reflected in our rules and removal reasons.  

&amp;#x200B;

You may be asking why we are making these changes:

&amp;#x200B;

**(1)** Well, as stated at the beginning of this post, we realise that oftentimes people weren‚Äôt getting their issues responded to in a timely fashion, if they ever even received an answer. By allowing users to make their own post detailing the issue they need help with - their issue will gain more visibility which increases the chance of their issue being seen and resolved. 

**(2)** By the tech support thread being removed, we will be freeing up a sticky spot which we can use for other megathreads (such as a photography megathread, app discovery megathread, etc), or for simple announcements. 

*(We‚Äôll be looking into possibly adding on to this new system  by having a bot that can flair a post as ‚ÄúResolved‚Äù when the OP of the support post replies to a user with a solution that worked for them by using a special command like !resolved.)*

&amp;#x200B;

We‚Äôll monitor these changes and come back after the new year and discuss as a mod team. We may also call a community vote to see if they liked the changes or not. This is merely a trial, so nothing is set in stone yet. No harm in trying different options! Of course, people should really be going to Apple Support for their issues, but we do acknowledge that may not be an option all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, this may be the last mod post from us until the new year. I‚Äôd like to extend a massive thank you to everyone on the mod team who‚Äôs been volunteering their time this year to make this a safe and enjoyable community for iPhone fans from every corner of the globe, and also a huge thanks to all  our  users.  It‚Äôs amazing to see this community so close to 3 MILLION users! On  behalf  of  the  r/iPhone mod  team,  we  wish  you  a  well  deserved  holiday,  and  a  healthy  and  happy  new  year!",1

8659,"Yet another iPhone 12 pro or pro max threat :(But I am aiming for a very specific question - so I hope that it's still ok :)

Hi everyone,

End of August I got my first Apple product from work (macbook pro). Before that I was a firm believer that Apple product overpriced and for swag use only, but god how wrong I was - I SIMPLY LOVED IT. A few weeks later I got the AirPods pro and LOVED THEM as well. So now when the time comes and I need to upgrade my phone, after thinking about it for a while (using android from 2012) I decided to complete the switch and buy an iPhone :O

Currently I am using a Huawei Honor 7x (lame I know).

There are 2 things which I care about in my future phone, both are very travel oriented:

1. **Battery** \- I love a big battery. When travelling, in many cases I find myself waking up in the morning, spending the entire day hiking/walking etc using the phone to navigate, taking pictures, read stuff online and etc, and then in the evening entering a night bus, using the phone periodically thoughout the night, and then arriving at the destination in the morning needing some remaining juice in the battery to calmly find my hostel/hotel.
2. **Camera** \- I want it to be very very good as a point and shoot camera. I don't edit my photos afterwads.

Now, obviously the MAX is better for both of these. The question is - by how much? Is the photo quality on the max actually noticable?

My worry about the MAX is the size. I am not a small person (almost 1.90, around 6.2 in US measures), and my current phone is 156.5 x 75.3 x 7.6 mm which is not that far from the pro max's 160.84 x 78.09 x 7.39 mm and I am just fine with using it with a single hand, but the max is even bigger, and I am woudering if the camera and battery are worth the size.

Any opinions?

Thanks!",1
8660,Text from emailsSo I have an iPhone 11 Pro and I get spam text from random email accounts along with 20 other recipients that are sequentially next to my phone number. Is there anyway to block these text from random emails?,1
8661,"Should I wait to buy 12 until after display issue is fixed?Hey everyone. I realized the 12 is having some display issues, and Apple thinks they can fix this through a software update. 

Should I wait until this update is released to buy the 12? I wouldn't want to risk getting getting stuck with a defective phone that can't be fixed with a software update. A couple Qs to inform this decision - 

1. Are we confident that this is fixable with a software update? 
2. Does anyone have a guess as to when Apple will try to release this update? 
3. Would Apple care cover replacing the phone if it's not a software issue? 
4. Are a large number of phones suffering from this problem to begin with? 

Any insight here is helpful.",1

I charged the phone for her but, powered it on and it says it is ""disabled"".  The phone says connect to iTunes.  iTunes says the phone is locked and we need to enter the code.  She knows the code but the phone won't even ask for it.  Any ideas?  Phone has been lost for 6+ years, so there is no computer backup.

Recently I forgot I hadn't wiped my old phone, and all my texts were going through to it (RCS texts), so I couldn't send any messages from my iPhone, and I wondered why. 

I decided to factory reset my Android after moving my stuff, which automatically disables RCS. I had to reset tho because even though I disabled RCS in my settings, it didn't fully deactivate.

Randomly remembered that I had factory reset it, and lo and behold, I was activated with iMessage within 10 seconds.

TLDR: If you're moving from Android, either factory reset your phone or disable RCS (chat features). It somehow fucked with my iMessage activation.",1

I‚Äôm WFH (even pre-covid) so outside of the case going in and out of my pocket throughout the day the case really gets no use or wear to speak of. So when I purchased my new 12 Pro Max I of course immediately grabbed the leather case (shipped prior to receiving the phone). I‚Äôve had the phone (in case) for 2.5 weeks and this is the wear I‚Äôm already experiencing... this is ridiculous. I don‚Äôt even have this much wear on previous Apple leather cases after years of use. You can tell the case is some very VERY thin leather (type-product) almost painted onto a plastic shell. This is a joke, never again. Be forewarned, it‚Äôs not worth it.

9357,"Diy MagSafe charger for older iPhonesOne of the things that i like about the new iPhone 12 is the MagSafe, however, its not worth it for me to upgrade from my current iPhone Xs max. I was hoping to find a MagSafe case that have built in magnets for older iPhones, so i can mount my iPhone in my car with a wireless charger car mount, but couldn‚Äôt fine any. 

I however, found MagSafe magnets membrane and a wireless charger car mount that is compatible with with MagSafe in AliExpress:

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001698659539.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.678f4c4dRobbu4

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001661427276.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.678f4c4dRobbu4

I ordered them and got them today. I tried to tape the MagSafe magnet membrane to the external side of my iPhone cover, and then attach the MagSafe wireless charger. It was charging fine, but I haven‚Äôt testing the charging speed yet; theoretically, it should charge the iPhone with 7.5 W; But as you can see in the video below, it looks ugly and the tape won‚Äôt stick to the cover. I might try to glue the membrane to the cover, however, ideally i want the MagSafe to be hidden inside the cover. I will try to contact Chinese case suppliers to see if they can make MagSafe cases for older iPhones.

9364,"Is there a chance the wireless Qi charging issues with the iPhone 12 Pro could be fixed with a software update?Since my I noticed my phone wouldn't charge properly with my Anker wireless charger, I did some digging and found out that this has something to do with the magnet placement on the new iPhones, and people reported that a few workarounds include placing the phone horizontally on the stand or lifting it about 1cm higher. Since the second option is what worked for me, that made me think this a hardware issue that can't be fixed with a software update.

Other people, however, have reported being able to fix the problem simply by updating the software or restarting the phone, which makes me think that this something that could potentially be solved in a future software update. Although these did not work for me.

So my question is: is there a possibility a future software update will fix this so that I don't have to charge my phone with a pencil underneath it, or should I just accept it already and just get a new wireless charger that works for my iPhone 12 Pro?",1

11995,"Kind of shocked by how good my $150 phone is.My OnePlus 6T died after an unfortunate drop into concrete. I was expecting a call that day, so I went to a local store and bought a Moto G Fast thinking I'd use it temporarily before getting a ""real phone"" and I'd keep the Moto G as a backup.

You know what though? I'm keeping it as my daily driver. It's actually *shockingly* good. The battery lasts longer than my old phone. It's got a headphone jack! What $1000 phone has one if those these days? It's not filled with bloatware, and it does the basics all pretty well. Calls sound no different. The speaker is good enough. The vibration motor is significantly better than my previous phone. 

I thought I'd mind a 720p display, but honestly I've stopped noticing. Who needs 90hz 1440p displays anyway? It just seems like overkill to me now.

Sure, it's not always the snappiest device in the world and isn't made of super premium materials. It's got bigger bezels than a higher tier phone would have. But who cares? Honestly the only thing that bothers me really is Motorola's update policy. But I've used plenty of other much more expensive phones with pretty shit update policies too.",0

15869,"[AMA] I'm Dieter Bohn, Executive Editor at The Verge. Ask Me Anything!Greetings Mobile Accomplishers:

I'm Dieter, one of the founding editors at The Verge and currently our Executive Editor. I also tweet puns sometimes and typos always over at [@backlon](https://twitter.com/backlon).

I've been reviewing Android and Android phones since the very beginning, with [Android on the G1 over at Android Central](https://www.androidcentral.com/review-android-t-mobile-g1). Whenever I get called an Apple shill I remind people I founded Android Central. Whenever I get called an Android shill I remind people I founded iMore. I'm obsessed with RCS for some reason? Also the web. Also, yes, webOS.

I used a Galaxy S20 for most of the year, but recently switched over to a Pixel 5 (There was some OnePlus and Galaxy Z Flip in there for awhile too). I of course also use iPhones -- usually I have two phones on me.

Anyway I'm fascinated by consumer tech and think that it deserves genuine attention as a category of products that takes part in creating our culture. I also believe that most people are smarter than they're given credit for and shouldn't be talked down to when it comes to tech. When I have the time I [make videos in that vein](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL39u5ZEfYDEOI-EYh3NUfmiSdVrn6echI). 

*Anyway again*, at The Verge I'm still reviewing a ton of stuff, making YouTube videos, and writing a [newsletter called *Processor*](https://www.theverge.com/processor-newsletter-dieter-bohn-show-video) -- both about consumer technology. I also co-host The Vergecast along with Nilay Patel. 

I'll be answering questions from 12:30ET to 2:30 ET (give or take). Ask me anything!",0

17271,"[PSA] - Free Stadia Bundle ""Account Not Eligible"" FixI've shared this as  a comment in a few associated threads in other subs, but hope it's ok to post here for visibility.

In Canada, I'm on a Family Plan and the link informed me my account wasn't eligible.

I contacted support using [this](https://support.google.com/store/gethelp) link and they told me I needed to be signed up as a Stadia Pro subscriber, so I did so using the 1mo trial. I then waited patiently on chat hold for about 1h and spoke with the Stadia team, who confirmed my Stadia membership and YT Premium status.

The next day an agent called and while on the phone with me, sent me a link that let me redeem the offer successfully. Note that only the *Clearly White* bundle was offered with no option to change it (not sure if others were able to use a code to claim whatever color they wanted - my link was a direct shopping cart link tied to my email address)

Hope this helps other Canadians or others internationally in a similar situation!",0

17279,"Let's talk about the Android Share Menu/InterfaceSo as most of you know, Google has been struggling with the sharing interface for many versions now. One of their major focuses in Android Q/10 was improving the speed at which this interface triggered (primarily due to poor caching behaviours), and further tweaked for Android 11 

However, while the new menu/interface loads much more quickly, the inconsistencies of what options lie therein seem even more confusing..

Sharing URLs or products from Chrome suggest contacts in Messages (Default Text app), Telegram, or WhatsApp, but never those that are current or even recent - If I'm having a conversation with someone, switch to Chrome to look something up that's related to our chat, then hit share, that conversation should be one of the first couple suggestions, but it never seems to be the case.. This then forces users to scroll through the list of apps to find the one they want alphabetically, then choose a contact from there

I don't really understand the reasoning or design behind this interface.. The fact that it suggests random people on random platforms (I've had it recommend sending an Instagram contact a private message when I last used it over a month prior) - is there a better way to set this up to work efficiently, or some wayo to control what and who are suggested?",0

That being said, I'm getting tired of these skinny phones, I miss my 16:9 Nexus 6, with how it managed to have good real state while not being too tall and easy to reach with my fingers

I get I'm a strange use case, but there are NONE of these on the market anymore: the last 16:9 one I can recall is the iPhone 8, and the smaller Pixel 2, which is super tiny. Even Xiaomi hasn't made any and they make a phone every week.

I lurk here often but the last time I did an AMA was like [five years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3bgd3r/ama_michael_fisher_of_pocketnow/). (So, for what seems like the fifth time this week, I get to say: ""damn, I'm getting old, eh?"")

Since 2015, I've teamed up with Mobile Nations (now Future plc) to launch the [MrMobile YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/themrmobile), which recently crossed the 1M subscriber mark. More importantly, mobile tech has shaken out of its mid-decade slump and gotten much more exciting with the advent of [foldable phones](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwd8abTO4vh3FQQrjgjxPHkJLiL4BS39h), swinging phones, rollable phones, and so on. It's a great time to be a tech YouTuber.

I'm here to talk about crazy new phones, [crazy old phones](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwd8abTO4vh2smuMzykXDOPNnsxhHC4Oh), wearables, life as a YouTuber, [ethics in tech reporting](https://www.mrmobile.tech/ethics), Jibo, Star Trek, seaQuest DSV ... pretty much anything you want. (Verification is in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/jv24ht/ama_announcement_michael_fisher_17th_of_november/).)

I'm here till 8p Eastern, so ask away!

**EDIT**: Whew! Ended up staying an hour over, just because y'all have really well-structured questions and I wanted to answer as many as I could. I feel terrible leaving the longer ones un-answered, folks, but my eyes are blurry and my gf (and my favorite roommate, the cat) are waiting for me to join them for dinner.

17559,"Let's talk about Android Auto and YouTube MusicSo as most of you know, Google phased out Google Play Music and they are forcing everyone to go on YouTube Music. I

I personally used the transferring tool to transfer my playlists and while the tool was not 100% accurate it transferred almost everything. And I personally understand that it is not possible to make the automatic tool to be perfect. Furthermore I noticed that there are some songs that were available on Google Play music but not on YouTube music.

However, the thing that is frustrating me the most is that YouTube music is broken on Android Auto and more specifically is that when you select to shuffle your playlist, next time you connect your phone the shuffle will be deselected. Furthermore, according to some other people reporting similar issues, the shuffle option only works for about 20 songs and then it just get deselected. Btw this problem is not new as it has been [reported about a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/ds1g83/youtube_music_shuffle_play_with_aa/)

It is really stupid from Google to force to use a service that it is not ready. If you wanna to have people test your product offer incentives. Honestly, the only thing that keeps me from not going to Spotify is the ad free experience from YouTube but I don't know how many more compromises I feel like doing.",0

17573,"Why Android and the phone manufacturers that use it pushed me to iOSI still remember when the first Android was released. How it was doing things different than Apple and the users had choice and more control. It kept evolving and it was great. Even OEMs were introducing their own improvements looking to differentiate. Yet, slowly, but steady, fragmentation started to grow. OEMs started to not include all features from Android Vanilla which in some cases are great. Vendors started to more and more pack their phones with adware and bloatware. Updates were less and less frequent. Prices kept going up and up.

I was the guy that rooted my phones, unlocked the bootloader so I could try the latest Paranoid Android release and keep my phone with the latest Android version. Yet, things slowly started to change. Rooting became harder, unlocking bootloader would blow the efuses, phone functionalities would be lost, there's a higher risk of bricking your device. Priority now was ads on Android. And to top it all, Android OS fragmentation is crazy high these days.

My last android was a Galxy S8. Love most of it. Great camera, nice screen, IP6x, and a bunch of other nice things. Didn't like the price, that in EU you can't get Snapdragon, the curved display, and that once Samsung released a new device, mine was just old history for them. They also introduced new features that the S8 is more than capable to run, but artificially blocked them for only the new devices. 

While my S8 works quite well, it was losing out on new Android features and even on some Samsung features. I started doing my research to see if I would go for another Samsung, a Moto, Sony or even a 1+ or Pixel. Then I started to see the trend in prices, trying to match iPhone prices. I was ""WTF? Price is one of the benefits of buying Android"". Then I started to see how more bloatware was pushed into your device that you can't delete. Ads being pushed into your device from official OEM apps where no ad should ever be there. Android kept making questionable choices in how data was being managed and how Android worked in the background. Yet I kept looking. I mean, iOS? Why the fuck. Them with their walled garden bullshit.  Then I gifted my mum a pair of Galaxy Buds+. She had a borderline mid range phone, but with the minimum specs that should have allowed for the earphones to work. Nope, nothing. OK, it was not new and it was not Samsung. She went and bought a mid range Samsung. It connected, but there were some issues. Then she wanted to change the audio balance. I told her where to go and how to do it. Nothing... Nada. My brother had a go and could not find such option. Me thinking they were useless took on the task of showing them ho2 it was set. Nope, the setting is just not there. Then WhatsApp calls can't be answered with the Bud+. You have to answer the call from the phone and then hit the Bluetooth do the call would move to the Bluetooth. I also have the Bud+ and have the same issue. I also bought an Amazfit  smart watch that kept sending who knows what to some Chinese IP addresses. The app was invasive AF as well as not very reliable. Then I met my kids iphones. Everything changed.

They had only the iPhone 6s, very old. Just recently it got the iOS 14 update. Since a birthday was coming I decided to gift them an Apple Watch. Again, another epiphany. Got the thing out of the box and right away it asked to be paired with the 6s. Just like magic. No apps to set, no fumbling with settings. Once you say yes, it is just a matter of pointing the camera to some swirling dots and everything else is automatic or answering accept. I got right away why people buy Apple. It's just hassle free. For sure there must be issues I'm not aware, but as a person that works with technology since early age, I've never experienced anything like that. Then I played a bit with iOS. Then read a bit. The things I was looking for in a phone were all there: integration, security, privacy and functionality. I decided to make the jump and wow, it's hard to compare. I won't make this post any longer. The reason of posting it here is because I'm very sad Android is going in the direction it's going and Google keeps promising they would fix fragmentation and updates and support and a bunch of other things, but all they keep doing is add a feature to then take it or change it to make it almost useless and then bring it in some half baked for on some new OS version. There are things I would never be able to replace like Tasker or Reddit Is Fun, but what I've gained is far more valuable. I sure hope Android goes back to when it was exiting and may go back to it in the future, but I can't be bothered to pay a lot of money for an Android flagship that misses the mark on a bunch of stuff when I can buy an iPhone for the same or cheaper (never thought I would write those words) and have equal or better functionality while having more privacy, better integration between apps and more support.",0
