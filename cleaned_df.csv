Now I have to return the phone.

Issues:
1. Screenshots severely lagging. Either they don’t pop up at all and are hidden in my photos or it takes 20-30 seconds to pop up.

2. When taking a picture with the camera app in the messaging app, black screen with spinning wheel appears for a few seconds and picture never ends up being taken.

I leave for work on a morning on 100% and for example it’s dinner time now and i’m down to 35% batter with only 1h17 mins of screen on time - barely used it at all.

Does anyone have any suggestions is my battery faulty as there is no way it should drain like this. i’ve always had iPhones so I know how battery’s get after a while but this is honestly ridiculous.

It’s not so much of a problem at the minute as. I have chargers at the only 2 places i go due to lockdown home and work. My concern will be when things return to normal and I start going on days off that the phone will basically be useless.

Is anyone else having similar issues or any suggestions would be much appreciated.

1854,"A Report On Why iPhone 12 Series Devices Are Terrible, ComparativelyI’m going to preface this commentary with the disclosure that I am an Apple fan, and I’m typing this on my iPhone X (November 2017). 

The current iPhones—the 12 series—were redesigned, and brought back to a virtually identical geometry to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 series of devices. This redesign is objectively worse in innumerable ways, and I’ll detail each respectively. 

In November 2017 Apple released the best physical iPhone design in materials and geometric shape, they have ever made, up to this date. The iPhone X, while geometrically identical to the iPhones since 2014, added a stainless steel band, and a glossy rear-glass panel. It was the first and only iPhone I have used without a case, and I’m still using this same iPhone without a case, because it was the first iPhone that had material design that offered grip (outside of the original few and the 5C). Aluminum and matte glass are both far more slippery, and disable the user from using the device without a case because the probability of dropping it is categorically increased.  

The following year Apple released the iPhone XS, which was still great in terms of materials and geometry, but due to the inclusive of LTE improvements they redesigned the antenna bands such that it now had asymmetric bands and this could be visually seen in the band separations. Moreover, speaker holes on the bottom of the device also became asymmetric due to this change. With this asymmetry, the device was physically worse than the iPhone X, but still fine. 

In 2019 Apple released the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. The iPhone 11 used an aluminum band which is astronomically more slippery than glossy stainless steal, which made this device virtually unusable without a case. Again, far worse than the iPhone X. The iPhone 11 Pro was switched to a matte rear-glass panel which had two extreme drawbacks: it was categorically more slippery, and it feels far worse than glossy glass to the touch. Again, this device virtually assures that users put a case back on their iPhone because it has a far more slippery material design, and it feels gritty to the touch, rather than extremely smooth. I also want to point out that the intention was to reduce the appearance of scratches and smudges on the back of the device... this is an inherently flawed and ironic logic because in so doing, they increased the slipperiness of the device by an enormous amount, and guaranteed that users place it in a case, thereby nullifying the scratch and smudge resistance gained. You design for comfort and the ability to hold the device without a case, that takes precedence over all. Again, this device is far worse than the iPhone X. 

In 2020 Apple just recently released the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro series of devices. Now, Apple has switched back to a completely squared edge, and completely flat glass. Let me break down each reason why this is astronomically inferior design, and they should at worst, reintroduce the symmetric, rounded design alongside the square design.",1

3.) Take one of the airpods out of your ear. This will pause the iPhone sound.

4.) Put it back in and sound will move from iPhone to Mac.

I jumped in the pool at midnight and forgot my phone was in my pocket. Classic dumbass move. I got out immediately. It was still on and working, and that's when I learned that the iphone 8 has water resistance. Tight.

I get home and the display screen looks like there's water underneath it. Great. I turn it off and put it in some rice. Today, the water has moved around, but the phone was still working. I turned it off again and removed the sim card slot to check the water damage indicator, and it's completely untouched. 

Should I be worried? Should I put it back in some rice, give it a few days? Am I completely fucked? Is it possible to just get water underneath the screen without damaging the insides? Any help is appreciated!",1

4404,Is there a way to get your screen time passcode?Hey. So apparently I’m 10 years old and my parents decided to put screen time on my phone (I’m 15 btw). I know how this sounds so cringy but please keep reading. I’d say I understand iOS as an operation software pretty well and I have tried every possible way to get the passcode. The thing is that I don’t want to change the password I just wanna find out what it is. So after my useless tries to get the passcode I started googling how to get it. I found a pretty cool website and tool called [pinfinder.](https://pinfinder.dot)net For a sec I thought I found a way how to actually get the passcode but pinfinder only works up to iOS 12.4. I think you can’t really get the passcode just using only your phone because iOS is just too safe. So please if you know about any tools like pinfinder let me know.,1

6692,"Is the xr still worth it today ???!So guys I want to buy the iPhone xr but unfortunately I couldn't hold one in hand nor was I able to hold the X so I can't possibly imagin the deference in screens both of them offers
Ofcorse all of us know the obvious defrences between bother of them cpu,screen,battery so it's a straight forward comparison but since I couldn't test such core aspects without owning the phone I thought it will be right to ask those who spent the most time with it and will be the most honest.
So if you please can you tell me what I will be messing on with both options and if it's worth it in your opinion and why? 
Thanks in advance.",1

6694,"Yet another iPhone 12 pro or pro max threat :(But I am aiming for a very specific question - so I hope that it's still ok :)

Hi everyone,

End of August I got my first Apple product from work (macbook pro). Before that I was a firm believer that Apple product overpriced and for swag use only, but god how wrong I was - I SIMPLY LOVED IT. A few weeks later I got the AirPods pro and LOVED THEM as well. So now when the time comes and I need to upgrade my phone, after thinking about it for a while (using android from 2012) I decided to complete the switch and buy an iPhone :O

Currently I am using a Huawei Honor 7x (lame I know).

There are 2 things which I care about in my future phone, both are very travel oriented:

1. **Battery** \- I love a big battery. When travelling, in many cases I find myself waking up in the morning, spending the entire day hiking/walking etc using the phone to navigate, taking pictures, read stuff online and etc, and then in the evening entering a night bus, using the phone periodically thoughout the night, and then arriving at the destination in the morning needing some remaining juice in the battery to calmly find my hostel/hotel.
2. **Camera** \- I want it to be very very good as a point and shoot camera. I don't edit my photos afterwads.

Now, obviously the MAX is better for both of these. The question is - by how much? Is the photo quality on the max actually noticable?

My worry about the MAX is the size. I am not a small person (almost 1.90, around 6.2 in US measures), and my current phone is 156.5 x 75.3 x 7.6 mm which is not that far from the pro max's 160.84 x 78.09 x 7.39 mm and I am just fine with using it with a single hand, but the max is even bigger, and I am woudering if the camera and battery are worth the size.

Any opinions?

Thanks!",1

Basically it’s just very slow and lagging. Anyone know why? It’s updated with the latest IOS so idk what it is",1

Recently I forgot I hadn't wiped my old phone, and all my texts were going through to it (RCS texts), so I couldn't send any messages from my iPhone, and I wondered why. 

I decided to factory reset my Android after moving my stuff, which automatically disables RCS. I had to reset tho because even though I disabled RCS in my settings, it didn't fully deactivate.

Randomly remembered that I had factory reset it, and lo and behold, I was activated with iMessage within 10 seconds.

TLDR: If you're moving from Android, either factory reset your phone or disable RCS (chat features). It somehow fucked with my iMessage activation.",1

I’m WFH (even pre-covid) so outside of the case going in and out of my pocket throughout the day the case really gets no use or wear to speak of. So when I purchased my new 12 Pro Max I of course immediately grabbed the leather case (shipped prior to receiving the phone). I’ve had the phone (in case) for 2.5 weeks and this is the wear I’m already experiencing... this is ridiculous. I don’t even have this much wear on previous Apple leather cases after years of use. You can tell the case is some very VERY thin leather (type-product) almost painted onto a plastic shell. This is a joke, never again. Be forewarned, it’s not worth it.

If anyone can tell me why it’s doing it and how to stop it I’d be very much so appreciative.,1
7223,"Diy MagSafe charger for older iPhonesOne of the things that i like about the new iPhone 12 is the MagSafe, however, its not worth it for me to upgrade from my current iPhone Xs max. I was hoping to find a MagSafe case that have built in magnets for older iPhones, so i can mount my iPhone in my car with a wireless charger car mount, but couldn’t fine any. 

I however, found MagSafe magnets membrane and a wireless charger car mount that is compatible with with MagSafe in AliExpress:

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001698659539.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.678f4c4dRobbu4

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001661427276.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.678f4c4dRobbu4

I ordered them and got them today. I tried to tape the MagSafe magnet membrane to the external side of my iPhone cover, and then attach the MagSafe wireless charger. It was charging fine, but I haven’t testing the charging speed yet; theoretically, it should charge the iPhone with 7.5 W; But as you can see in the video below, it looks ugly and the tape won’t stick to the cover. I might try to glue the membrane to the cover, however, ideally i want the MagSafe to be hidden inside the cover. I will try to contact Chinese case suppliers to see if they can make MagSafe cases for older iPhones.

7230,"Is there a chance the wireless Qi charging issues with the iPhone 12 Pro could be fixed with a software update?Since my I noticed my phone wouldn't charge properly with my Anker wireless charger, I did some digging and found out that this has something to do with the magnet placement on the new iPhones, and people reported that a few workarounds include placing the phone horizontally on the stand or lifting it about 1cm higher. Since the second option is what worked for me, that made me think this a hardware issue that can't be fixed with a software update.

Other people, however, have reported being able to fix the problem simply by updating the software or restarting the phone, which makes me think that this something that could potentially be solved in a future software update. Although these did not work for me.

So my question is: is there a possibility a future software update will fix this so that I don't have to charge my phone with a pencil underneath it, or should I just accept it already and just get a new wireless charger that works for my iPhone 12 Pro?",1

8811,"Is It Wise To Buy Refurbished Apple?# Buying Refurbished Apple/Mac

Considering a refurbished Apple is not getting one for cheap but it is a smart choice, first of, by saving money which costs one-third of the price of the purchasing brand new items. And also ecologically responsible choice with the reuse and recycling that helps in environment impact.

![video](3f7d02nc5y061)

**What to consider in buying refurbished Apple?**

The first issue is to figure out what you wanted; an upgraded RAM or CPU or SSD you need to wait until one of those appears in the online Apple store or authorized store for refurb devices, and buy it immediately, which many do not hesitate in considering a refurb one. Which is way more cheaper than the new one and as good as something brand new.

Most refurbished will be based on models, likely with the minimal RAM: phones or iPads or MacBooks.

**Where to buy refurbished Apple products?**

Apple.com don’t sell refurbished products in store, however they do online just visit the site.

And other authorized parties

**Gazelle**

**SellYourMac**

**Tradeamac**

These stores does not only sells refurbished devices but also trad-ins. Offers a trade in with your old devices to a new model.  It depends on the country though as not all countries can offer this but tradeamac in Canada does, also they  buy all new, used, refurbished, unwanted, broken Apple products for a fair rice, which typically pays higher than the others.

**Where is the cheapest place to find refurbished Apple products in Canada?**

[**https://www.facebook.com/tradeamaccanada**](https://www.facebook.com/tradeamaccanada)**,** which they do buy bulks or an overstock devices.

It's an open beta right now so you have to download testflight for it to work, the link should guide you

If you didn't get a verification email please check your spam, it has been going to spam weirdly

Also here's a short video of how it works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXS3HOB\_Ja8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab\_channel=ChaiTheApp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXS3HOB_Ja8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=ChaiTheApp) (the asthethics are not up to date in the video but the way it works is)

I'd love to get feedback - tweet me @ chaitheapp on twitter or you can just leave a review on the app page.

If you care about why I made it:

So basically I graduated from college this summer and moved to a new city for my job. I'm pretty much completely alone in this new city and it's basically impossible to make new friends right now because of the whole pandemic situation. Let's just say my mental health has not been great and I have felt pretty overwhelmed and not really sure how to fix anything.

A lot of times I felt like I just wanted to talk to someone about something to feel better but it's really hard to reach out to people because it feels like they're still living their lives and don't have time for you. This app is essentially just a way to reach out to anyone and have a random conversation about anything so that you can talk about your problems or anything that makes life feel just a bit more normal.

Thanks for reading!

9947,"4.63'' is the effective screen size for watching 16:9 videos on the iPhone 12 MiniThe standard aspect ratio for HD video is 16:9 so I wondered which screen size would I get from an iPhone 12 with 19.5:9 aspect ratio and 5.4 inches diagonally. 

The limiting factor here is the screen's width which is 1080 pixels. Therefore the corresponding length is 1080 \* 16 / 9 = 1920 pixels. With a resolution of  476 pixels per inch, we get a length of 4.03 inches and a width of 2.27 inches. Thus we get for the diagonal  

sqrt(4.03\^2 + 2.27\^2) = 4.63 inches",1

11634,"Kind of shocked by how good my $150 phone is.My OnePlus 6T died after an unfortunate drop into concrete. I was expecting a call that day, so I went to a local store and bought a Moto G Fast thinking I'd use it temporarily before getting a ""real phone"" and I'd keep the Moto G as a backup.

You know what though? I'm keeping it as my daily driver. It's actually *shockingly* good. The battery lasts longer than my old phone. It's got a headphone jack! What $1000 phone has one if those these days? It's not filled with bloatware, and it does the basics all pretty well. Calls sound no different. The speaker is good enough. The vibration motor is significantly better than my previous phone. 

I thought I'd mind a 720p display, but honestly I've stopped noticing. Who needs 90hz 1440p displays anyway? It just seems like overkill to me now.

Sure, it's not always the snappiest device in the world and isn't made of super premium materials. It's got bigger bezels than a higher tier phone would have. But who cares? Honestly the only thing that bothers me really is Motorola's update policy. But I've used plenty of other much more expensive phones with pretty shit update policies too.",0

This weekly Sunday thread is for you to let off some steam and speak out about whatever complaint you might have about:  

* Your device.  

* Your carrier.  

* Your device's manufacturer.  

* An app  

* Any other company

***  

**Rules**  

1) Please do not target any individuals or try to name/shame any individual. If you hate Google/Samsung/HTC etc. for one thing that is fine, but do not be rude to an individual app developer.

2) If you have a suggestion to solve another user's issue, please leave a comment but be sure it's constructive! We do not want any flame-wars.  

3) Be respectful of other's opinions. Even if you feel that somebody is ""wrong"" you don't have to go out of your way to prove them wrong. Disagree politely, and move on.",0

14537,"[AMA] I'm Dieter Bohn, Executive Editor at The Verge. Ask Me Anything!Greetings Mobile Accomplishers:

I'm Dieter, one of the founding editors at The Verge and currently our Executive Editor. I also tweet puns sometimes and typos always over at [@backlon](https://twitter.com/backlon).

I've been reviewing Android and Android phones since the very beginning, with [Android on the G1 over at Android Central](https://www.androidcentral.com/review-android-t-mobile-g1). Whenever I get called an Apple shill I remind people I founded Android Central. Whenever I get called an Android shill I remind people I founded iMore. I'm obsessed with RCS for some reason? Also the web. Also, yes, webOS.

I used a Galaxy S20 for most of the year, but recently switched over to a Pixel 5 (There was some OnePlus and Galaxy Z Flip in there for awhile too). I of course also use iPhones -- usually I have two phones on me.

Anyway I'm fascinated by consumer tech and think that it deserves genuine attention as a category of products that takes part in creating our culture. I also believe that most people are smarter than they're given credit for and shouldn't be talked down to when it comes to tech. When I have the time I [make videos in that vein](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL39u5ZEfYDEOI-EYh3NUfmiSdVrn6echI). 

*Anyway again*, at The Verge I'm still reviewing a ton of stuff, making YouTube videos, and writing a [newsletter called *Processor*](https://www.theverge.com/processor-newsletter-dieter-bohn-show-video) -- both about consumer technology. I also co-host The Vergecast along with Nilay Patel. 

I'll be answering questions from 12:30ET to 2:30 ET (give or take). Ask me anything!",0

15590,"[PSA] - Free Stadia Bundle ""Account Not Eligible"" FixI've shared this as  a comment in a few associated threads in other subs, but hope it's ok to post here for visibility.

In Canada, I'm on a Family Plan and the link informed me my account wasn't eligible.

I contacted support using [this](https://support.google.com/store/gethelp) link and they told me I needed to be signed up as a Stadia Pro subscriber, so I did so using the 1mo trial. I then waited patiently on chat hold for about 1h and spoke with the Stadia team, who confirmed my Stadia membership and YT Premium status.

The next day an agent called and while on the phone with me, sent me a link that let me redeem the offer successfully. Note that only the *Clearly White* bundle was offered with no option to change it (not sure if others were able to use a code to claim whatever color they wanted - my link was a direct shopping cart link tied to my email address)

Hope this helps other Canadians or others internationally in a similar situation!",0

15597,"Let's talk about the Android Share Menu/InterfaceSo as most of you know, Google has been struggling with the sharing interface for many versions now. One of their major focuses in Android Q/10 was improving the speed at which this interface triggered (primarily due to poor caching behaviours), and further tweaked for Android 11 

However, while the new menu/interface loads much more quickly, the inconsistencies of what options lie therein seem even more confusing..

Sharing URLs or products from Chrome suggest contacts in Messages (Default Text app), Telegram, or WhatsApp, but never those that are current or even recent - If I'm having a conversation with someone, switch to Chrome to look something up that's related to our chat, then hit share, that conversation should be one of the first couple suggestions, but it never seems to be the case.. This then forces users to scroll through the list of apps to find the one they want alphabetically, then choose a contact from there

I don't really understand the reasoning or design behind this interface.. The fact that it suggests random people on random platforms (I've had it recommend sending an Instagram contact a private message when I last used it over a month prior) - is there a better way to set this up to work efficiently, or some wayo to control what and who are suggested?",0

I lurk here often but the last time I did an AMA was like [five years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3bgd3r/ama_michael_fisher_of_pocketnow/). (So, for what seems like the fifth time this week, I get to say: ""damn, I'm getting old, eh?"")

Since 2015, I've teamed up with Mobile Nations (now Future plc) to launch the [MrMobile YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/themrmobile), which recently crossed the 1M subscriber mark. More importantly, mobile tech has shaken out of its mid-decade slump and gotten much more exciting with the advent of [foldable phones](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwd8abTO4vh3FQQrjgjxPHkJLiL4BS39h), swinging phones, rollable phones, and so on. It's a great time to be a tech YouTuber.

I'm here to talk about crazy new phones, [crazy old phones](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwd8abTO4vh2smuMzykXDOPNnsxhHC4Oh), wearables, life as a YouTuber, [ethics in tech reporting](https://www.mrmobile.tech/ethics), Jibo, Star Trek, seaQuest DSV ... pretty much anything you want. (Verification is in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/jv24ht/ama_announcement_michael_fisher_17th_of_november/).)

I'm here till 8p Eastern, so ask away!

**EDIT**: Whew! Ended up staying an hour over, just because y'all have really well-structured questions and I wanted to answer as many as I could. I feel terrible leaving the longer ones un-answered, folks, but my eyes are blurry and my gf (and my favorite roommate, the cat) are waiting for me to join them for dinner.

Thanks so much for the opportunity to chat with you all – and thanks for always being so friendly to me here on the subreddit. As I said above, I lurk often, and I always appreciate your kindness! Be well, stay safe – and stay mobile!",0

15808,"Why Android and the phone manufacturers that use it pushed me to iOSI still remember when the first Android was released. How it was doing things different than Apple and the users had choice and more control. It kept evolving and it was great. Even OEMs were introducing their own improvements looking to differentiate. Yet, slowly, but steady, fragmentation started to grow. OEMs started to not include all features from Android Vanilla which in some cases are great. Vendors started to more and more pack their phones with adware and bloatware. Updates were less and less frequent. Prices kept going up and up.

I was the guy that rooted my phones, unlocked the bootloader so I could try the latest Paranoid Android release and keep my phone with the latest Android version. Yet, things slowly started to change. Rooting became harder, unlocking bootloader would blow the efuses, phone functionalities would be lost, there's a higher risk of bricking your device. Priority now was ads on Android. And to top it all, Android OS fragmentation is crazy high these days.

My last android was a Galxy S8. Love most of it. Great camera, nice screen, IP6x, and a bunch of other nice things. Didn't like the price, that in EU you can't get Snapdragon, the curved display, and that once Samsung released a new device, mine was just old history for them. They also introduced new features that the S8 is more than capable to run, but artificially blocked them for only the new devices. 

While my S8 works quite well, it was losing out on new Android features and even on some Samsung features. I started doing my research to see if I would go for another Samsung, a Moto, Sony or even a 1+ or Pixel. Then I started to see the trend in prices, trying to match iPhone prices. I was ""WTF? Price is one of the benefits of buying Android"". Then I started to see how more bloatware was pushed into your device that you can't delete. Ads being pushed into your device from official OEM apps where no ad should ever be there. Android kept making questionable choices in how data was being managed and how Android worked in the background. Yet I kept looking. I mean, iOS? Why the fuck. Them with their walled garden bullshit.  Then I gifted my mum a pair of Galaxy Buds+. She had a borderline mid range phone, but with the minimum specs that should have allowed for the earphones to work. Nope, nothing. OK, it was not new and it was not Samsung. She went and bought a mid range Samsung. It connected, but there were some issues. Then she wanted to change the audio balance. I told her where to go and how to do it. Nothing... Nada. My brother had a go and could not find such option. Me thinking they were useless took on the task of showing them ho2 it was set. Nope, the setting is just not there. Then WhatsApp calls can't be answered with the Bud+. You have to answer the call from the phone and then hit the Bluetooth do the call would move to the Bluetooth. I also have the Bud+ and have the same issue. I also bought an Amazfit  smart watch that kept sending who knows what to some Chinese IP addresses. The app was invasive AF as well as not very reliable. Then I met my kids iphones. Everything changed.

They had only the iPhone 6s, very old. Just recently it got the iOS 14 update. Since a birthday was coming I decided to gift them an Apple Watch. Again, another epiphany. Got the thing out of the box and right away it asked to be paired with the 6s. Just like magic. No apps to set, no fumbling with settings. Once you say yes, it is just a matter of pointing the camera to some swirling dots and everything else is automatic or answering accept. I got right away why people buy Apple. It's just hassle free. For sure there must be issues I'm not aware, but as a person that works with technology since early age, I've never experienced anything like that. Then I played a bit with iOS. Then read a bit. The things I was looking for in a phone were all there: integration, security, privacy and functionality. I decided to make the jump and wow, it's hard to compare. I won't make this post any longer. The reason of posting it here is because I'm very sad Android is going in the direction it's going and Google keeps promising they would fix fragmentation and updates and support and a bunch of other things, but all they keep doing is add a feature to then take it or change it to make it almost useless and then bring it in some half baked for on some new OS version. There are things I would never be able to replace like Tasker or Reddit Is Fun, but what I've gained is far more valuable. I sure hope Android goes back to when it was exiting and may go back to it in the future, but I can't be bothered to pay a lot of money for an Android flagship that misses the mark on a bunch of stuff when I can buy an iPhone for the same or cheaper (never thought I would write those words) and have equal or better functionality while having more privacy, better integration between apps and more support.",0

This weekly Sunday thread is for you to let off some steam and speak out about whatever complaint you might have about:  

* Your device.  

* Your carrier.  

* Your device's manufacturer.  

* An app  

* Any other company

***  

**Rules**  

1) Please do not target any individuals or try to name/shame any individual. If you hate Google/Samsung/HTC etc. for one thing that is fine, but do not be rude to an individual app developer.

2) If you have a suggestion to solve another user's issue, please leave a comment but be sure it's constructive! We do not want any flame-wars.  

3) Be respectful of other's opinions. Even if you feel that somebody is ""wrong"" you don't have to go out of your way to prove them wrong. Disagree politely, and move on.",0
