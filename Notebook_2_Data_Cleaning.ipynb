Usually when I forget to charge at night it’s somewhere between 30 and 40% \\n\\nI don’t think it’s normal for my phone to take over an hours to power on whenever it dies, my Samsung would be dead for several days and it powers on as soon as I plug it to the charger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
       "Hey r/Android! I lurk here often but the last time I did an AMA was like [five years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3bgd3r/ama_michael_fisher_of_pocketnow/). (So, for what seems like the fifth time this week, I get to say: \"damn, I'm getting old, eh?\")\\n\\nSince 2015, I've teamed up with Mobile Nations (now Future plc) to launch the [MrMobile YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/themrmobile), which recently crossed the 1M subscriber mark. More importantly, mobile tech has shaken out of its mid-decade slump and gotten much more exciting with the advent of [foldable phones](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwd8abTO4vh3FQQrjgjxPHkJLiL4BS39h), swinging phones, rollable phones, and so on. It's a great time to be a tech YouTuber.\\n\\nI'm here to talk about crazy new phones, [crazy old phones](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwd8abTO4vh2smuMzykXDOPNnsxhHC4Oh), wearables, life as a YouTuber, [ethics in tech reporting](https://www.mrmobile.tech/ethics), Jibo, Star Trek, seaQuest DSV ... pretty much anything you want. (Verification is in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/jv24ht/ama_announcement_michael_fisher_17th_of_november/).)\\n\\nI'm here till 8p Eastern, so ask away!\\n\\n**EDIT**: Whew! Ended up staying an hour over, just because y'all have really well-structured questions and I wanted to answer as many as I could. I feel terrible leaving the longer ones un-answered, folks, but my eyes are blurry and my gf (and my favorite roommate, the cat) are waiting for me to join them for dinner.\\n\\nThanks so much for the opportunity to chat with you all – and thanks for always being so friendly to me here on the subreddit. As I said above, I lurk often, and I always appreciate your kindness! Be well, stay safe – and stay mobile!        1\n",

       "I’ve always had the saddle leather iPhone case... they have always held up (for me). I’m WFH (even pre-covid) so outside of the case going in and out of my pocket throughout the day the case really gets no use or wear to speak of. So when I purchased my new 12 Pro Max I of course immediately grabbed the leather case (shipped prior to receiving the phone). I’ve had the phone (in case) for 2.5 weeks and this is the wear I’m already experiencing... this is ridiculous. I don’t even have this much wear on previous Apple leather cases after years of use. You can tell the case is some very VERY thin leather (type-product) almost painted onto a plastic shell. This is a joke, never again.
